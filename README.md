## Hey There! üëã

Just wanted to make it clear - this is a fan project made by people (me lol) who love Shadow Slave and wanted to create something cool for the community. We're not affiliated with the official Shadow Slave creators in any way.

The server is and always will be completely free to play! We're not into pay-to-win stuff at all. If you want to support us keeping the server running, you can grab some cosmetic goodies through donations, but they're totally optional and won't give any gameplay advantages. Everything that matters in the game can be earned just by playing.

We're just fans making something fun for other fans. Hope you enjoy hanging out here! üòä
